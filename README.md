This study develops a compartmental model to accurately capture pertussis incidence in the United States between 1 January 2022 and 17 August 2025. The model is stratified by the four U.S. Census regions and further distinguishes cases across three age groups. A particularly noteworthy feature of the observed data is the sharp rise in incidence around November 2024. The model is therefore deliberately specified to replicate this peak, which is consistently employed as a reference outcome in model fitting, sensitivity analyses, and other performance evaluation.

The study also explores the potential emergence of a drug-resistant pertussis population in the U.S. The study extends the baseline compartmental framework to incorporate a resistant strain, thereby examining its potential epidemiological implications even in the absence of strong U.S. evidence to date.
